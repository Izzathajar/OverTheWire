### Level 1
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory. Since the filename is '-', we need to provide the current directory of the file.

### Level 3
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory. Use command ls -la to display all files inside the directory including hidden file. To read hidden file, we need to put . infront of the file name to indicate that it is a hidden file.
```markdown

2.ls -la to display all files
3.cat .hidden

The password is:pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

### Level 4
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Human-readable file means ASCII format. So we must find the file with ASCII format to get the password. We can use find command followed by file command to check the file type.
```markdown
1.cd into inhere
2.ls to display all the files
3. find -type f to select all files inside the directory and use xargs(extended argument) to add argument which is file to check the file type
4. read the output file which is -file07

The password is : koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
```

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
```markdown

We can use find command to find specific file. We can use command such below to find the file.
```markdown

```markdown
/ : find files from entire system
-f : to find file type
