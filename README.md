## Introduction

The main objective of this repository is to explain how to pass each level of Linux bandit challenge. 

### Level 0

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

```markdown
1. Ssh into the server bandit0 at port 2220 using ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
2. Insert the password: bandit0
3. Go to level 1
